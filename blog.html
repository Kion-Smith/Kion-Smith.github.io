					<h2>Ideas and Frustration</h2>
					<h3>June 13 2018</h3>

					<p>
						I have had a few ideas for what projects I want to finish and others to start. Firstly I want to add a hold key to the Tetris game example from onelonecoder,after using all of what I learned from that video I want to finally finish my Tetris version with a menu and sound effects. I also want to make a video to accompany these new projects,I have been wanting to make videos but these summer classes take up alot of the day and take alot out of me. That's where the frustration kicks in I want to make things and also want to learn about other areas like UNIX/Linux,C/C++,python,AI,app design,etc... the list goes on and on but as I said before my summer classes are eating so much time and then family obligations and responsibilities have also been getting in the way. I plan on fixing this and this post will be there as a reminder for my self. I ramble a lot in these.

					<h2>Test Blog/ Why commits have been lacking</h2>
					<h3>June 7 2018</h3>
					<hr size=" 10" noshade color="WHITE">
					<p>
						I finally got around to adding this Blog! Not sure how often I will use this, I just wanted to start and test out making a blog on this website. I want to catalog that all my commits to GitHub have been very lacking due to time constraints; I want to do more but summer classes are keeping me back. It's still my fault for not being time efficient now, and during the school year taking classes as seriously as I should. However, I am going to change that by adding a schedule of what to work on once I know my work load. I am not doing this because I am doing extremely bad but because I know I have the potential to be better than I currently am, and if I don't try and live up to my standards what would the point of wanting to be a CS major? As to not end on a downer I wanted to say that this C++ windows.h method of making games is much quicker than in java not to mention reinvigorated my passion for game making. The RPG clone project (Based on Pok√©mon) has been fairly easy to do in my spare time and has also been enjoyable. I have been trying to work on being more efficient with my code in this project and I hope it shows.
