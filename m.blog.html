				<h2>Test Blog/ Why commits have been lacking</h2>
				<h3>June 7 2018</h3>
				<p>
					I finally got around to adding this Blog! Not sure how often I will use this, I just wanted to start and test out making a blog on this website. I want to catalog that all my commits to GitHub have been very lacking due to time constraints; I want to do more but summer classes are keeping me back. It's still my fault for not being time efficient now, and during the school year taking classes as seriously as I should. However, I am going to change that by adding a schedule of what to work on once I know my work load. I am not doing this because I am doing extremely bad but because I know I have the potential to be better than I currently am, and if I don't try and live up to my standards what would the point of wanting to be a CS major? As to not end on a downer I wanted to say that this C++ windows.h method of making games is much quicker than in java not to mention reinvigorated my passion for game making. The RPG clone project (Based on Pok√©mon) has been fairly easy to do in my spare time and has also been enjoyable. I have been trying to work on being more efficient with my code in this project and I hope it shows.
